Yo, this is a dope little Node.js script that flips your CSV files into JSON like a boss. No fuss, just results.

This bad boy grabs a CSV, turns each row into a JSON object, and spits it out in a slick array. Headers from the CSV? They’re your keys, fam.

## Features, Yo

- Headers become keys, no sweat.
- Works with basic comma-separated CSVs.
- Runs from the command line, easy peasy.

## What You Need

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/csv-to-json-js.git
